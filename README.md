# Todolist
A To-Do List in Django is a web-based application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks efficiently. It is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
This project is a great beginner-level application to practice CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Django.
