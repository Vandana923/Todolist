# Todolist
A To-Do List in Django is a web-based application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks efficiently. It is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
This project is a great beginner-level application to practice CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Django.
# Key Components:
Models: Define the structure of a task (e.g., title, description, due date, completion status).
Views: Handle user requests (e.g., add, edit, delete, or view tasks) and interact with the database.
Templates: HTML files render dynamic content like task lists and forms for user interaction.
Forms: Provide input fields for creating or updating tasks.
URL Routing: Maps URLs to specific views for task management.
 # Core Features:
Add new tasks with relevant details.
Mark tasks as completed or pending.
Edit or delete tasks.
View all tasks in an organized list.
Filter tasks based on status or due dates.
# Workflow:
Users interact with a user-friendly interface (HTML and CSS).
Data is processed via Django views and saved in the database.
Tasks are displayed dynamically using Django templates.
# Tools Used:
Django ORM: Manages database interactions.
SQLite/MySQL: Stores task data.
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap: Ensures an interactive and responsive design.
